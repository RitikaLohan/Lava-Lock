# Lava-Lock
LavaLock 🔐 is a simulated secure password generator that uses image entropy, inspired by Cloudflare’s lava lamp wall. By extracting randomness from uploaded images and hashing with SHA-256, it creates strong, unique, and unguessable passwords. A fun and educational project in cryptography and security.
